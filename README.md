Beginnings of a point-n-click styled game in C++ using RAYLIB.

This project is inspired mostly by the old DOS point-n-click games. Because I'm building the engine from scratch, there
has been and will be a lot of trial and error writes and rewrites. With that being said, the art for it is acquired from
free online sources at the moment. The majority of the early period of starting this project has been building up and 
figuring out the main functionality--and continues to be, for now-- so there hasn't been any time to work on any of the 
art just yet.
Thank you.
